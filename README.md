# AGI Class

The `AGI` class is a part of the FluidLatticeAI framework. It represents an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) model that uses a lattice structure to process and learn from sequences of data.

## Class Structure

The `AGI` class contains the following private members:

- `lattice`: A pointer to a `FluidLatticeAI::Lattice` object.
- `sequence`: A vector of doubles representing the sequence of data the AGI is learning from.
- `currentIndex`: An integer representing the current index in the sequence.

The class also contains several public methods for perceiving the environment, reasoning, learning, making decisions, and communicating.

## Usage

To use the `AGI` class, you need to initialize it with a sequence of data. The AGI will then perceive its environment, reason, learn, make decisions, and communicate based on this sequence.

The class also includes methods to increase the spirit level, become conscious, check the flow state, and enter the flow state. These methods manipulate the internal state of the `FluidLatticeAI::Lattice` object to affect the AGI's behavior.
